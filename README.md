This project rearranges a real life small data set of teachers and their classes used at an Italian high school. 
It was originally pressented as a table in Word, then saved as a csv-file. The tabel is ordered by surname of the teachers. However, each teacher has more classes, creating multiple values in one cell. 
A new list is needed, grouped by classes and school types. 
We use pandas, to clean the data and rearrange it to create a more structured table, that present the four school types, dived by classes and then ordered alphabeticaly.
